# MERN GENERATOR

*CRUD Module Generator for MERN Framework.*


The CRUD module generator will help you create a new CRUD module, similar to the article sample provided with the project.

## Getting Started

Before you begin make sure you have the [yo scaffolding tool](http://yeoman.io/learning/index.html) installed (As it is part of the Yeoman tool set you might have installed it before). To globally install *yo* you will need to use npm:

```
$ npm install -g yo
```

**Note:** Your user might not have the permissions to install package globally, so use a super user or **sudo**.

Once you have *yo* installed, you will need to clone the MERN generator as well.

You are now ready to get started with the MEAN.JS generator. The generator will help you create a MEAN.JS application.
