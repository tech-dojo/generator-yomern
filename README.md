# MERN GENERATOR

*CRUD Module Generator for MERN Framework.*


The CRUD module generator will help to create a new CRUD module, similar to the article sample provided with the project.


## Getting Started

Make sure the [yo scaffolding tool](http://yeoman.io/learning/index.html) has been installed (It is part of the Yeoman tool). To globally install *yo* use npm:
```
$ npm install -g yo
```
**Note:** User might not have the permissions to install package globally, use a super user or **sudo**.

After *yo* has been installed, clone the MERN generator as well.

Install dependencies with `npm install`

Now it's ready to be used.
